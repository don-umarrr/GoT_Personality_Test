Hello, thank you for using the Game of Thrones Personality Test!
This program will ask you a series of questions that will determine which Game of Thrones
character you are most like!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To get started, make sure you have located the folder on your computer named GoTquiz.
Once located, double-click the indexNew.html file.
This will open the site in your default web browser.

If you are opening the folder in the CS50 IDE you will need to take a few more steps.
After downloading the folder this README document is in, you will need to open a terminal.
In the terminal you will need to navigate to the folder named GoTquiz. You can do this
by using the cd command.
Once in the folder that contains the indexNew.html file, run the following command:
"http-server"
You will then see a long link that starts with https. Click on that link and it will open
a page with the quiz on it.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will then see the home page of the test.
In the center you will see a Begin Test button that is underlined.
Click the Begin Test button.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will then be prompted to answer multiple questions.
After selecting your answer you will click the next button.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After answering all the questions you will see a message that says you've completed the
test.
Click on the See Result button to see which Game of Thrones character you most resemble.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After the test is completed and you have a character, feel free to close the tab or
browser it is running in.
